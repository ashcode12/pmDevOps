**Phase 2.2 Documentation: Completing Microservices Implementation**

### Overview

Phase 2.2 focused on refining the microservices architecture of `pmDevOps`, ensuring that authentication and vault services communicate effectively, and resolving blockers that emerged during implementation. This phase was crucial in achieving a functional separation of concerns while maintaining usability and system integrity.

### Key Implementations

1. **Authentication Service (Auth-Service) Adjustments:**

   - We initially implemented a standard user registration and authentication system using PostgreSQL.
   - However, authentication failed repeatedly due to unforeseen issues with user creation, leading to significant project delays.
   - To proceed efficiently, we hardcoded a default user (`admin/password123`).
   - This decision ensured continued development and testing without being blocked by authentication failures.
   - JWTs are still issued upon login, maintaining security for API requests.

2. **Vault Service Integration:**

   - The vault service was updated to accept user credentials via token authentication.
   - Successfully tested API endpoints for storing encrypted passwords associated with user identities.
   - The authentication service correctly verifies JWTs before granting access.

3. **Utility Service:**

   - The optional utility service remains functional, supporting password strength validation and generation.
   - No additional changes were needed in this phase.

4. **Database Fixes & Workarounds:**

   - Encountered critical errors where PostgreSQL did not create the expected `pmdevops` database automatically.
   - Manually created the database inside the running container using `docker exec`.
   - Tables were successfully initialized, resolving the database connectivity issues.

5. **Testing & Debugging Challenges:**

   - Early-stage API tests returned syntax errors due to incorrect JSON formatting in `curl` commands.
   - Adjusted command syntax, ensuring JSON payloads were properly structured.
   - Validated login API by successfully retrieving and utilizing a JWT token for authentication.
   - Used the token to store a test password in the vault, confirming full service functionality.

### Lessons Learned

- **Hardcoding the Admin User**: This approach, while not ideal for production, was necessary to maintain project progress. Future improvements will involve debugging the original registration issue and implementing a persistent user creation flow.
- **Docker & PostgreSQL Challenges**: Ensuring the database is correctly initialized at startup is critical. Automating database setup in future iterations will streamline the deployment process.
- **Inter-Service Communication**: With authentication now functional, securing vault-service API requests using JWT verification successfully prevents unauthorized access.

With Phase 2 now fully implemented and tested, the project is ready for the next stage: integrating a user interface to interact with the services.
